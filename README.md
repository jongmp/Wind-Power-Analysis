## Introduction

All of the data for this project was collected from the National Centers for Environmental Information. The original data included Climate Data from weather stations worldwide and included several million data points for each year. The data was cleaned and organized through mysql. The link to the original weather data is included [here](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/metadata/geoportal/rest/metadata/item/gov.noaa.ncdc:C00861/html).
